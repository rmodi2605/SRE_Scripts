# Web Service Endpoints Health Checker

The objective of this Project is to continuously check multiple web service endpoint health and get an email alert if any endpoint is either unreachable or any error, exception occurs.
<br>

## Technology Used for the Project

- Python

- SMTP

- Linux
<br>

## Prerequisites
Genrate App Password for Trigger email on Gmail OR your Chosen email platform. 

Here, I used Gmail for gettting email alert.

1. Login into Gmail Account
2. Go to **Manage your Google Account**
3. Select **Security**
4. Enable Two-Step Verification
5. Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, return to the Security tab
<br> Scroll down and click on App Passwords.
6. Generate an App Password
7. Copy App Password (16-character app password) immediately as it can only be viewed once.
<br> Save it somewhere safe.

<br>


## Initial Steps
1. Add email key in Linux environment variable

```bash
export email_password="wnfunops********"
```

<br>

2. Varify email key in environment variable

```bash
echo $email_password

wnfunops********
```
<br>

3. Make Script Executable 
```bash
cd SRE_Scripts/Web_Service_Health_Checker 

sudo chmod +x Web_Service_Health_Checker.py
```

<br>

4. Run it
```bash
source ~/py_envs/bin/activate

python Web_Service_Health_Checker.py
```
<br>
